                    I don't believe in fortune telling or fortune tellers. However, I was raised by my very
                    superstitious parents (think "don't shake your keys, we'll get into a fight" type of parents).
                    So I took a deep dive into learning and researching different forms of fortune telling. This led to 
                    me asking several different types of fortune tellers to tell me my fortune. Through this 
                    book, I just wanted to express this experience without showing bias. I just wanted to 
                    share what exactly happened. <br>

                    The book is split into sections. The beige sections are all 
                    of the research I have done and trying to figure out information about different forms 
                    of fortune telling.

                    As someone who sincerely loves movies and especially likes period pieces, when Little Women (directed by Greta Gerwig)
                    came out I was hooked. Me being 19 when it came out, I watched the movie more times than I can count. Since the movie 
                    lived in my mind for months and months, I did what any designer would do, make a book based on the screenplay. <br>

                    I had, what felt like, a strange desire to type my notes in my own handwriting. To me, handwriting is 
                    such an idetifying feature and I felt like my notes didn't feel like my notes because they weren't in my 
                    handwriting. This led me to go through the process of creating a typeface that is based around my handwriting, 
                    and I did suddenly have the feeling that my notes felt more like me. Due to this, I wanted to use my handwriting
                    in one of my designs. <br>

                    Specifically a redesigning of David Foster Wallace's "Consider the Lobster". I used my 
                    handwriting to stylize the footnotes to look the notes the reader would take in the margins, as the footnotes got
                    longer, the more the "notes" would bleed into the main body text.<br>

                    As someone who typically welcomes technological advances, the growth
                    of AI/AI "art" made me stop and think about what is art? The discussion of 
                    what art is has been surround art for as long as art has been around. Through 
                    my own personal analysis I came to the decision that art needs to be human made.
                    There are so many forms of art, all drawn us in and entrance us, because they are
                    so viscerally human. However, I thought of a solution. The concept of a "virtual gallery
                    for virtual art", a space for AI "art" to exist without taking the space of human made art.
                    Everything inside the gallery was generated by a GAN, as well as the writing in the gallery book.
                    Thought the content is computer generated, the project still requires a human touch. I was the 
                    one who designed the gallery, I was the one who designed the gallery book, I was the one who 
                    bound the book, even though all of the content was computer made.

                    Type specimens with unique presentations and themes make me incredibly interested in the type
                    and excited to use it. Although I haven't made a typeface (at this point), I was inspired by a type I 
                    very much like, Mission Gothic, and I created these type specimens. The theme around them was based around
                    gossiping and talking bad about other typefaces. Some using the background of the typeface as "insults" and others 
                    what we, generally, think of the typefaces. !I am not associated with Mission Gothic. I just like it a lot!
