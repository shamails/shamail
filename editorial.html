                    I don't believe in fortune telling or fortune teller. However, I was raised by my very
                    superstitious parents. (think "don't shake your keys, we'll get into a fight") So I took
                    a deep dive into learning and researching different forms of fortune telling. This led to 
                    me asking several different types of fortune tellers to tell me my fortune. Through this 
                    book, I just wanted to express this experience without showing bias. I just wanted to 
                    share what exactly happened. The book is split into sections. The tan sections are all 
                    of the research and indepently figure information about different forms of fortune telling.
                    The blue sections are based around actual readings that I got, sharing what they said and 
                    how it impacted me.

                    As someone who typically welcomes technological advances, the growth
                    of AI/AI "art" made me stop and think about what is art? The discussion of 
                    what art is has been surround art for as long as art has been around. Through 
                    my own personal analysis I came to the decision that art needs to be human made.
                    There are so many forms of art, all drawn us in and entrance us, because they are
                    so viscerally human. However, I thought of a solution. The concept of a "virtual gallery
                    for virtual art", a space for AI "art" to exist without taking the space of human made art.
                    Everything inside the gallery was generated by a GAN, as well as the writing in the gallery book.

                    As someone who sincerely loves movies and especially likes period pieces, when Little Women 
                    came out I was hooked. Me being 19 when it came out, I watched the movie more times than
                    I can count. Since the movie lived in my mind without forgeting, I did what any designer would do, 
                    make a book based on the screenplay. Every page in the book is every line containing the main character's
                    name. The cover is the first line, and back cover being the last line.

                    Type specimens with unique presentations and themes make me incredibly interested in the type
                    and excited to use it. Although I haven't made a typeface (at this point), so inspired by a type I 
                    very much like, Mission Gothic, I created these type specimens. The theme around them was based around
                    gossiping and talking bad about other typefaces. !!!!I am not associated with Mission Gothic. I just like it 
                    a lot!!!!
