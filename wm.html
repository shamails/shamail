                    I love plants, but I do have to admit that it is an incredibly difficult
                    hobby to get into or learn about. There are so many factors that you need
                    to take into account when purchasing a new plant. My solution to this was 
                    to boil down the factors that could potently cause issues and have the user
                    complete a quiz to pair them with the best plant for them.  <br>

                    Every morning I seem to stare at the weather app, confused as to what to 
                    wear. Would I be too hot? Would I be too cold? I look through all of my 
                    outfit photos trying to figure out what would be appropriate for this 
                    weather. I finally had enough and had the idea of a weather app that 
                    also logs your outfits so I can avoid this exact situation. The app
                    lists your outfits that the user wore in similar weathers, as well as what 
                    other people in the same weather are wearing. <br>

                        user the weather and outfit options for the rest of the week.<br>

                    I was at some point a preteen girl with an obsession with writing about my day in my diary.
                    I, still, constantly find myself having the desire to write and the talk about my life in a 
                    space just for me. I don't know whether that the archivist in me or the remains of the joys of 
                    having a diary.<br>

                        when I was a child. I thought the raining letters were a cute way to display enough for the

                        <br>Not Working Today was based around the feeling of doing nothing on a day off. Most of the 
                        time I viewed it as such a negative thing, but writing down that you have simply relaxed. It's 
                        not always a bad thing to relax, but it is a nice thing to remember what you did on days off.

                    As someone who typically welcomes technological advances, the growth
                    of AI/AI "art" made me stop and think about what is art? The discussion of 
                    what art is has been surround art for as long as art has been around. Through 
                    my own personal analysis I came to the decision that art needs to be human made.
                    There are so many forms of art, all drawn us in and entrance us, because they are
                    so viscerally human. However, I thought of a solution. The concept of a "virtual gallery
                    for virtual art", a space for AI "art" to exist without taking the space of human made art.
                    <br>

                        <div class="gg-1">
                            <img src="gg-1.png" id="gg-1">
                        </div>
                        <br>Everything inside the gallery was generated by a GAN, the gallery itself was made 
                        and layouted by me. The gallery was first created in blender, then I created it in 3.js as
                        well. <br>
                        <!-- <div class="gg-2">
                            <img src="gg-2.png" id="gg-2">
                        </div> -->
                        <div class="gg-4">
                            <img src="gg-4.png" id="gg-4">
                        </div>
                        <br> Along with the gallery, I created a gallery book that has computer generated art critques.
                        Just like the gallery, the content was generated but I was the one who designed and layouted the book.
                        <br>
                        <div class="gg-3">
                            <img src="gg-3.png" id="gg-3">
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        Thought the content is computer generated, the project still requires a human touch. I was the 
                        one who designed the gallery, who designed the gallery book, who  bound the book even though all of
                        the content was computer made. <br>
