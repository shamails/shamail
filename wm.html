                   I love plants, but I do have to admit that it is an incredibly difficult
                    hobby to get into or learn about. There are so many factors that you need
                    to take into account when purchasing a new plant. My solution to this was 
                    to boil down the factors that could potently cause issues and have the user
                    complete a quiz to pair them with the best plant for them. Through the 
                    app, the user can also have guides assisting them on care after purchase.

                    As someone who typically welcomes technological advances, the growth
                    of AI/AI "art" made me stop and think about what is art? The discussion of 
                    what art is has been surround art for as long as art has been around. Through 
                    my own personal analysis I came to the decision that art needs to be human made.
                    There are so many forms of art, all drawn us in and entrance us, because they are
                    so viscerally human. However, I thought of a solution. The concept of a "virtual gallery
                    for virtual art", a space for AI "art" to exist without taking the space of human made art.
                    Everything inside the gallery was generated by a GAN, as well as the writing in the gallery book.

                <div class="project-5-content">
                    I was at some point a preteen girl with an obsession with writing about my day in my diary.
                    I, still, constantly find myself having the desire to write and the talk about my life in a 
                    space just for me. I don't know whether that the archivist in me or the remains of the joys of 
                    having a diary.
                    <br>Not Working Today was based around the feeling of doing nothing on a day off. Most of the 
                    time I viewed it as such a negative thing, but writing down that you have simply relaxed. It's 
                    not always a bad thing to relax, but it is a nice thing to remember what you did on days off.
                    <br>Rainy Days is inspired by those password protected diaries that were incredibly popular 
                    when I was a child. I thought the raining letters were a cute way to display enough for the 
                    writer to know what the day was about, but not a stranger. Then after the password is entered 
                    the whole entry will be displayed.
                    <br> Good Days is simply a notebook online. It's the most physically inspired by a diary and 
                    it's just a nice was to have the user write about their day.
