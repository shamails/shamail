                    I love plants, but I do have to admit that it is an incredibly difficult
                    hobby to get into or learn about. There are so many factors that you need
                    to take into account when purchasing a new plant. My solution to this was 
                    to boil down the factors that could potently cause issues and have the user
                    complete a quiz to pair them with the best plant for them. Through the 
                    app, the user can also have guides assisting them on care after purchase. 
                    There is also a library section that the user can log the type of plants 
                    the users have and contains any necessary information on the plants.

                <div class="project-2-content">
                    Every morning I seem to stare at the weather app, confused as to what to 
                    wear. Would I be too hot? Would I be too cold? I look through all of my 
                    outfit photos trying to figure out what would be appropriate for this 
                    weather. I finally had enough and had the idea of a weather app that 
                    also logs your outfits so I can avoid this exact situation. The app
                    lists your outfits that the user wore in similar weathers, as well as what 
                    other people in the same weather are wearing. For logging outfits the 
                    user can label each piece using brands, material, fabric, color, etc. so they
                    know what pieces and what the outfit was exactly. The outfit not only shows the 
                    user the weather and outfit options for the rest of the week, as well.

                <div class="project-4-content">
                    As someone who typically welcomes technological advances, the growth
                    of AI/AI "art" made me stop and think about what is art? The discussion of 
                    what art is has been surround art for as long as art has been around. Through 
                    my own personal analysis I came to the decision that art needs to be human made.
                    There are so many forms of art, all drawn us in and entrance us, because they are
                    so viscerally human. However, I thought of a solution. The concept of a "virtual gallery
                    for virtual art", a space for AI "art" to exist without taking the space of human made art.
                    Everything inside the gallery was generated by a GAN, as well as the writing in the gallery book.
                    Thought the content is computer generated, the project still requires a human touch. I was the 
                    one who designed the gallery, I was the one who designed the gallery book, I was the one who 
                    bound the book.

                        the whole entry will be displayed.

                        <br>Not Working Today was based around the feeling of doing nothing on a day off. Most of the 
                        time I viewed it as such a negative thing, but writing down that you have simply relaxed. It's 
                        not always a bad thing to relax, but it is a nice thing to remember what you did on days off.
